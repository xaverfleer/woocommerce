This page includes documentation related to WooCommerce Block Templates.

## Overview

WooCommerce Block Templates are a collection of WooCommerce Core templates for the WordPress Full Site Editing experience introduced in WordPress 5.9. You can customize these templates in the Site Editor.

You can read more about the Full Site Editing (FSE) experience [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/full-site-editing/).

## Technical Overview

### The Problem

Currently, the FSE feature does not accommodate loading block templates from plugins such as WooCommerce (or WooCommerce Blocks). Instead, all template files loaded natively must be present within the active theme's templates folder. When the active block theme doesn't come with WooCommerce specific templates, we want to be able to provide sensible defaults, though.

### The Solution

We created a custom solution which involves a handful of files (listed in the below table) that are responsible for both making the templates available as a block template, and rendering it on the front-end.

The BlockTemplateController.php is primarily responsible for hooking into both WordPress core, and WooCommerce core filters to load WooCommerce [templates](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/tree/trunk/templates/templates) in the Site Editor and on the front-end. It is in this class where the majority of the logic is handled.

### Some things to be aware of

-   For each template, we have a version represented by a placeholder block and a blockified one, which uses more granular blocks. That was done to keep backwards compatibility for extensions in existing stores.
-   At the beginning of the project, we unintentionally used the incorrect WooCommerce plugin slug. This has resulted in us maintaining both the incorrect and correct slugs. We reference these via `BlockTemplateUtils::DEPRECATED_PLUGIN_SLUG` and `BlockTemplateUtils::PLUGIN_SLUG`. More information on that [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/issues/5423).
-   If a theme has a `archive-product.html` template file, but does not have any taxonomy related files. The `archive-product.html` template will be applied to all product taxonomy archives. Themes can override product taxonomy archive templates with `taxonomy-product_cat.html` and `taxonomy-product_tag.html` templates.
