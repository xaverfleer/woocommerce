Significance: patch
Type: tweak
Comment: If either the upcoming WooCommerce Shipping or WooCommerce Tax extension is active, don't suggest WooCommerce Shipping & Tax in the "Collect sales tax" Home task.  This only adjusts the extension recommendation merchants receive and does not affect any other functionality.
