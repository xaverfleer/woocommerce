Users must be able to perform all actions of the functionality provided. This can be achieved by running user tests.

To run an effective user test, list as many scenarios your extension supports. An example of a scenario: "I am a store owner who wants to create a customizable product that includes letting customers add custom text and select from 5 different color options for the custom text." Give this scenario to testers, and watch them attempt/perform the task with your extension.

Different ways to do quick user testing:

- Recruit potential customers to test your product.
- Use online services that allow you to expose your extension to new users such as UserTesting.com.
- Ask enthusiasts in the [WooCommerce Community Slack](https://woocommerce.com/community-slack/) for feedback.
