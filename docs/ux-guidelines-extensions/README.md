This section covers general guidelines, and best practices to follow in order to ensure your product experience aligns with WooCommerce for ease of use, seamless integration, and strong adoption.

We strongly recommend you review the current [WooCommerce setup experience](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/) to get familiar with the user experience and taxonomy.

We also recommend you review the [WordPress core guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) to ensure your product isn't breaking any rules, and review [this helpful resource](https://woocommerce.com/document/grammar-punctuation-style-guide/) on content style.

## General

Use existing WordPress/WooCommerce UI, built in components (text fields, checkboxes, etc) and existing menu structures.

Plugins which draw on WordPress' core design aesthetic will benefit from future updates to this design as WordPress continues to evolve. If you need to make an exception for your product, be prepared to provide a valid use case.
