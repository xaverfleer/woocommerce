Upon submission theme authors must provide a way for the theme to be showcased and tested. The sample content/demo should refrain from using custom graphics/assets that will not be present in the deliverables to avoid merchant confusion and broken expectations (examples: using logos, illustrations). When creating a theme for a specific vertical theme authors should consider using sample content that aligns with the vertical.

All imagery and text should be appropriate for all ages/family-friendly. The theme author should consider using imagery that is inclusive of ages, nationalities, etc. The theme should refrain from using imagery that looks like 'stock photography'.

The theme must be distributed and cleared of all the necessary licenses for assets such as images, fonts, icons, etc.
