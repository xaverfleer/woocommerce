Data leaks can expose sensitive information and compromise the security of a WooCommerce site. One common source of data leaks is direct access to PHP files. This tutorial will show you how to prevent these kinds of data leaks.

In each PHP file of your WooCommerce extension, you should check if a constant called 'ABSPATH' is defined. This constant is defined by WordPress itself, and it's not defined if a file is being accessed directly. Here's how you can do this:

```php
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
exit; // Exit if accessed directly
}
```

With this code, if someone tries to access the PHP file directly, the 'ABSPATH' constant won't be defined, and the script will exit before any sensitive data can be leaked.

Remember, security is a crucial aspect of any WooCommerce site. Always take steps to prevent data leaks and protect your site's information.
