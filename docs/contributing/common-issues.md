## Composer error on `Automattic\Jetpack\Autoloader\AutoloadGenerator`

```bash
[ErrorException]
  Declaration of Automattic\Jetpack\Autoloader\AutoloadGenerator::dump(Composer\Config $config, Composer\Repository\Inst

```

A recent [change](https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/b574f10d9d68acfeb8e36cad0b0b25a090140a3b#diff-67d1dfefa9c7b1c7e0b04b07274628d812f82cd82fae635c0aeba643c02e8cd8) in composer 2.0.7 made our autoloader incompatible with the new `AutoloadGenerator` signature. Try to downgrading to composer 2.0.6 by using `composer self-update 2.0.6`.

## VVV: HostsUpdater vagrant plugin error

```bash
...vagrant-hostsupdater/HostsUpdater.rb:126:in ``digest': no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError)
```

You might be running an unsupported version of Vagrant. At the time of writing, VVV works with Vagrant 2.2.7. Please check VVV's [requirements](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV#minimum-system-requirements).

## VVV: `install-wp-tests.sh` error

```bash
mysqladmin: CREATE DATABASE failed; error: 'Access denied for user 'wp'@'localhost' to database 'wordpress-one-tests''
```

To fix:

-   Open MySQL with `sudo mysql`.
-   Run `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'wp'@'localhost';`. Exit by typing `exit;`.
-   Run the `install-wp-tests.sh` script again.

## Timeout / 404 errors while running e2e tests

```bash
 Store owner can complete onboarding wizard â€º can complete the product types section

    TimeoutError: waiting for function failed: timeout 30000ms exceeded

      1 | export const waitForElementCount = function ( page, domSelector, count ) {
    > 2 | 	return page.waitForFunction(
        | 	            ^
      3 | 		( domSelector, count ) => {
      4 | 			return document.querySelectorAll( domSelector ).length === count;
      5 | 		},
```

Timeouts or 404 errors in the e2e tests signal that the existing build might be broken. Run `npm install && npm run clean && npm run build` to generate a fresh build. It should also be noted that some of our npm scripts also remove the current build, so it's a good practice to always run a build before running e2e tests.

## Docker container couldn't be built when attempting e2e test

```bash
Thu Dec  3 11:55:56 +08 2020 - Docker container is still being built
Thu Dec  3 11:56:06 +08 2020 - Docker container is still being built
Thu Dec  3 11:56:16 +08 2020 - Docker container is still being built
Thu Dec  3 11:56:26 +08 2020 - Docker container couldn't be built
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! @woocommerce/e2e-environment@0.1.6 test:e2e: `bash ./bin/wait-for-build.sh && ./bin/e2e-test-integration.js`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
```

Ensure that Docker is running. While the script says `Docker container is still being built`, it is not actually responsible for running Docker; it's just waiting for an existing docker instance to respond. Run `npm run docker:up` if it's not.

## Set up WooCommerce Payments dev mode

Add this to `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'WCPAY_DEV_MODE', true );
```

Also see [this document](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/testing-and-troubleshooting/sandbox-mode/).

## WooCommerce Admin install timestamp

To get the install timestamp (used in `wc_admin_active_for()` in `NoteTraits` for example) try this SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'woocommerce_admin_install_timestamp'
```

## Reset the onboarding wizard

Delete the `woocommerce_onboarding_profile` option:

```sql
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'woocommerce_onboarding_profile'
```

## Enable tracks debugging in the console

```javascript
localStorage.setItem( 'debug', 'wc-admin:tracks' );
```

and set Chrome's log level "verbose" to checked.

## Running PHP unit tests using Vagrant (VVV)

1. SSH into Vagrant box (`vagrant ssh`)
2. `cd /srv/www/<WP_INSTANCE>/public_html/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-admin`
3. Set up: `bin/install-wp-tests.sh wc-admin-tests root root`
4. Fast tests: `./vendor/bin/phpunit --group fast`
5. All tests: `./vendor/bin/phpunit`

You might need to `composer install` if `phpunit` doesn't exist.
