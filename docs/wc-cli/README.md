## Introduction to WooCommerce CLI

WooCommerce CLI (WC-CLI) offers an efficient way to manage WooCommerce (WC) stores via the command line. This tool is a part of WC from version 3.0.0 onwards and leverages the capabilities of the WC REST API. This means that most tasks achievable through the REST API can also be performed via the command line.

For documentation on WC versions 2.5 and 2.6's CLI, visit [Legacy CLI commands](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Legacy-CLI-commands-(v2.6-and-below)).

## About WP-CLI

WP-CLI is a powerful set of command-line tools for managing WordPress installations. You can update plugins, configure multisite installations, and much more, all without using a web browser. For more information, visit the [official WP-CLI website](http://wp-cli.org/).

## Getting Started with WooCommerce CLI

To begin using WC-CLI, ensure that you have WP-CLI installed and that you are running WooCommerce 3.0.0 or later. The CLI commands are accessed through the `wp wc` command. For a full list of available commands, type `wp wc` in your command-line interface.
