## Introduction

This guide provides an introduction to low-code solutions, such as Gutenberg and WooCommerce Store Editing, as well as other page builders and pre-built components for creating WooCommerce stores without custom coding. By understanding and leveraging these tools, low code builders can assemble stores with minimal coding and focus on the design and user experience aspects of their e-commerce websites.

## Audience

This guide is intended for low code builders or anyone with a basic understanding of WordPress and WooCommerce who wants to create online stores without the need for extensive custom coding.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you should have:

1. A basic understanding of WordPress and WooCommerce.
2. A WordPress website with WooCommerce installed and activated.

## Step 1 - Using Gutenberg and WooCommerce Store Editing

Gutenberg is the default block editor in WordPress that allows you to create and edit pages by adding and customizing blocks. WooCommerce has extended Gutenberg's functionality, enabling you to create and customize WooCommerce-specific elements, such as product pages and shop pages.

To use Gutenberg and WooCommerce Store Editing:

1. Ensure your WordPress installation is up-to-date to have the latest version of Gutenberg.
2. Install and activate a Block Theme to enable Store Editing features for WooCommerce.

With Gutenberg and WooCommerce Store Editing, you can create and customize your store's pages using a wide variety of blocks, such as text, images, buttons, and WooCommerce-specific blocks like product grids and shopping carts.

## Step 2 - Exploring alternative page builders

While Gutenberg and WooCommerce Store Editing are powerful options for building low-code WooCommerce stores, you may also consider using other page builders for more advanced features or specific use cases. Some popular page builders compatible with WooCommerce include:

1. Elementor
2. Beaver Builder
3. Divi Builder
4. WPBakery Page Builder

Choose a page builder that fits your needs and budget, then install and activate it on your WordPress website. These page builders typically offer a library of pre-built components that you can use to create a fully functional WooCommerce store without writing custom code.

## Step 3 - Utilizing pre-built components and templates

Many page builders, including Gutenberg, offer pre-built components or blocks that can be easily added to your pages. These components can include design elements like buttons, forms, and image galleries, as well as WooCommerce-specific components like product grids and shopping carts.

Additionally, some page builders and WooCommerce extensions offer pre-built store templates that you can import and customize to create a fully functional online store quickly. These templates can save you time and effort by providing a professionally designed starting point for your store.

To use pre-built components and templates:

1. Open your preferred page builder's editor (Gutenberg or another page builder).
2. Browse through the available components/blocks or templates and find the ones that suit your needs.
3. Add the components to your pages and customize them using the provided settings and options.

## Conclusion

By leveraging low-code solutions like Gutenberg, WooCommerce Store Editing, and other page builders, you can create a fully functional WooCommerce store without the need for custom coding. This guide has introduced you to the basics of using these tools, helping you understand the available options and assemble your store with minimal coding. With the right combination of tools and templates, you can create a professional, user-friendly e-commerce website that meets your business needs.
