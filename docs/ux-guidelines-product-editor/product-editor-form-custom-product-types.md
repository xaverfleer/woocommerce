Custom product types allow you to design a custom form and completely control its structure. They are convenient for extensions that enable merchants to create products from start to finish.

With custom product types, you can:

- Add, hide, and reorder groups
- Add and hide sections within a group
- Add and hide subsections and fields
    - Includes core fields
    - Can be set up conditionally based on a custom field's value

Custom product types include niche and specific use cases, such as bookings, tickets, gift cards, rentals, etc. Here's when we suggest you should consider creating a custom product type:

- Your extension consists of several different form sections scattered across several different tabs
- Using just your extension, merchants can completely a product
- You want to help merchants create products faster and automate some of their work
