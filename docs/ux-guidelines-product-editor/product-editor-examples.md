Depending on the type of your extension (and your use case), you can pick the interface location that best suits how users will interact with it.

To choose, put yourself in the merchant's shoes: where would you go to find this feature? What is it related to? Adding your extension to a group of similar features will help make it easier for merchants to find your extension.

See the guide below for some practical examples.

## Product code extension

### What it does

The extension allows merchants to enter a product identifier, such as ISBN, EAN, or UPC.

### Our recommendations

The identifier is a single piece of information that helps merchants describe and categorize the product across their store and other sales channels. It's best suited to be added as a field in the Product catalog section in the Organization group.

## Ticket extension

### What it does

Merchants can set up and sell tickets with advanced settings, such as unique input fields, expiration dates, restrictions, tiers, and more.

### Our recommendations

With so much advanced functionality, the plugin would best register a new product type and define the structure and appearance of the product form. This could include the tabs at the top of the screen, the subgroups and sections inside, and the default values.
