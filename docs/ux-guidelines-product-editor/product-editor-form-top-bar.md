Top bar extensions offer supplementary experiences **not vital** to the critical product creation flows. They're secondary, meaning that they shouldn't contain information that may impact the product's overall quality or completeness.

Each top bar extension has its unique icon in the top navigation bar. Note that when the number of extensions exceeds 4, they're truncated in a dropdown menu.

For example, top bar extensions can be used to:

- Provide product scheduling or extra visibility options,
- Let merchants view additional SEO metadata
- Offer easy access to documentation or step-by-step guides

Depending on their roles, top bar extensions can be displayed in either a **popover** or a **modal**.
